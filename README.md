cd qmem-cloud

Install Dependencies:
bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install

Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the required environment variables. Example:
env

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/qmemcloud

Running the Development Server
Start the development server:
bash

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application. The page auto-updates as you edit files, thanks to Next.js's hot module replacement.

Deployment
Qmem Cloud is deployed on Vercel with a reverse proxy to qmem.cloud for a custom domain.
Vercel Deployment
Push to GitHub:
Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository.

Connect to Vercel:
Sign in to Vercel.

Import your repository via the Vercel dashboard.

Configure the project settings (e.g., environment variables).

Deploy:
Vercel automatically deploys your app on push to the main branch. Alternatively, use the Vercel CLI:
bash

vercel

For production deployment:
bash

vercel --prod

Custom Domain:
Add qmem.cloud as a custom domain in the Vercel dashboard under Settings > Domains.

Reverse Proxy Configuration
To serve the Vercel deployment under qmem.cloud:
DNS Setup:
Point qmem.cloud to Vercel's servers using a CNAME record (e.g., cname.vercel-dns.com).

Alternatively, use an A record to Vercel's IP (check Vercel documentation).

Reverse Proxy (if needed):
If hosting on a custom server (e.g., Nginx), configure a reverse proxy to forward requests from qmem.cloud to the Vercel deployment URL (e.g., qmem-cloud.vercel.app).
Example Nginx configuration:
nginx

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name qmem.cloud;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://qmem-cloud.vercel.app;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

SSL/TLS:
Enable SSL via Vercel (automatic with custom domains) or use Cloudflare for additional security and performance.
